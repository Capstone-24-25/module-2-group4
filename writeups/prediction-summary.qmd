### Abstract

Provide a 3-5 sentence summary of your work on the primary task. Indicate what input data was used, what method was used for binary class predictions, what method was used for multiclass predictions, and what estimated accuracies were achieved.

> *Header and paragraph content was scraped from the raw webpages and processed into term frequencies of word tokens. For binary classification, a two-layer neural network yielded an estimated 81.4% accuracy; for multiclass classification, a support vector machine gave 78% accuracy.*

### Preprocessing

In one paragraph lay out your preprocessing pipeline. No need to provide exact step-by-step detail; just give an overview of the main components:

-   what text content was extracted from HTML

-   how text was cleaned

-   how cleaned text was represented quantitatively

The preprocessing pipeline is as follows, a dataset containing the text of each website is passed into R, then the data was cleaned by removing punctuation, symbols and other special characters from the text. Then all words were converted to lower case and turn into tokens of one word each(or two words in the case for ngrams). The `bind_tf_idf()` function is applied to the data frame to get the tf_idf values for each word of each website. The data frame is then pivoted so that each unique word is a column and the document as rows. The resulting data frame has rows of documents and columns of words and cells of tf_idf values of each word for each website.

### Methods

Describe your final predictive models. Include one paragraph with details on the binary classification approach, and one on the multiclass approach. Include for each:

-   what ML/statistical method was used

-   model specification and hyperparameter selection

-   training method

### Results

Indicate the predictive accuracy of the binary classifications and the multiclass classifications. Provide a table for each, and report sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.[^1]
