### HTML scraping

Does including header content improve predictions? Answer the question and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.

```{r}
load('results/base_metrics.RData')
load('results/headings_metrics.RData')
base_metrics
headings_metrics
```

Including header content does not improve the performance of the Logistic Regression model by an amount that would warrant the change in method. As can be seen in the two outputs above, by including header information, the model achieved a 0.2 increase in the roc_auc number. Also, sensitivity and accuracy decreased when including header content. This is most likely due to the fact that the header content in most websites within the dataset provided did not include useful information, thus adding it would not improve the model in any significant way.

### Bigrams

Do bigrams capture additional information relevant to the classification of interest? Answer the question, **briefly** describe what analysis you conducted to arrive at your answer, and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.

### Neural net

Summarize the neural network model you trained by desribing:

-   architecture

-   optimization and loss

-   training epochs

-   predictive accuracy
